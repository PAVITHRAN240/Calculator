Day 1 Task

This is a simple Java Console Calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
The program uses methods for each operation, Scanner for user input, and a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
What I learnt :
1.Practice with Java methods
2.Using Scanner for input
3.Implementing switch statements
4.Using loops for repeated execution

SAMPLE OUTPUT :
Choose operation: 1.Add 2.Subtract 3.Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
